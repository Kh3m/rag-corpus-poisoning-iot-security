provenance_utils.py

Simulates a lightweight provenance/fingerprint scheme for document
authenticity. This models a realistic deployment pattern: a trusted feed
(NVD, MITRE-ATT&CK, a vendor) signs each document it publishes using a
private key. Anyone consuming the feed can verify the signature using the
corresponding public key, without needing to trust the document's content
on its own.

For this simulation we use HMAC-SHA256 with a shared secret instead of a
full public-key signature scheme (RSA/ECDSA). This keeps the defense
lightweight and dependency-free, appropriate for edge deployment, while
still demonstrating the core security property: an attacker who does not
possess the secret cannot produce a signature that verifies correctly.

In a production system, each trusted source would have its own keypair,
and the secret below would be replaced by proper asymmetric signing. That
upgrade path is noted in the paper's future work.
